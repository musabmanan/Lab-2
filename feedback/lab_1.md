## Lab 1 Feedback

This is a good start, but there are some problems here which cause compiler errors. For instance, the circle class does
not have any variables called "base" or "height". I have commented those lines to ensure your other labs run.

Unfortunately, I cannot award any points for this lab, as it does not compile. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
Also, feel free to stop by office hours to clarify any trouble you are having with the ideas or language.
