## Lab 2 Feedback

This is a good start, but there are several things that can be improved upon. 

First, your MyStringLinkedList class is not actually implementing your MyStringList interface. 


In addition, your tests do not adequately cover the code, the StringNodeTest class is missing, and one test is actually failing.

Finally, I had to do some significant refactoring of project structure. We want all of our labs for a single course to be in the same repository.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the material, and feel free to come in to office hours if you feel unsure about certain implementations.
